# Fraud Detection Project README

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The model utilizes insights from feature importance and permutation importance to enhance fraud detection accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about transactions, including features such as transaction type, amount, customer details, and transaction outcomes (fraudulent or not). The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Feature Importance
Feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the most influential features in predicting fraudulent transactions. Two methods are used:

1. **Random Forest Feature Importance**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the dataset, and feature importances are extracted from the trained model. This provides insights into which features contribute the most to the predictive performance of the model.

2. **Permutation Importance**: Permutation importance is calculated as the decrease in model performance (e.g., accuracy) when the values of a feature are randomly shuffled. This method provides a more robust assessment of feature importance, especially when dealing with correlated features or non-linear relationships.

## Model Development
The machine learning model is developed using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. Various algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and others, are explored and compared for their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Additionally, confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to provide detailed insights into the model's performance on both training and testing datasets.

## Results
The results of the model evaluation, including feature importance analysis, are summarized and interpreted to provide actionable insights for fraud detection. Recommendations for further improvements and optimizations are also discussed.
